# My Personal Website 
Here is my personal website showcasing my job experience, resume, and projects. I used a modern bootstrap template with some flair to create a fresh and eyecatching website. 
I am a young professional working in an IT role at AdventHealth Corporate, looking to better my education and skills to be an asset wherever I go. I am currently studying to become a web developer and have completed Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 2023. I am also taking a Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms Masterclass and learning React. I am working on my portfolio to showcase the skills that I have learned throughout my journey. With my background in IT and aspirations to become a developer, I believe I can be a good fit in any organization. I welcome any contact regarding future opportunities or if you would like to simply chat!
